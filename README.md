# Wyper

A small and simple GUI library (archived) that was used to create
my school project, an image editor namely [Wypeditor](https://github.com/amaank404/wypeditor).

The library is not well optimized or well structured or documented
for maintainibility. This roots from the quick development requirements
for the school porject to finish on deadline. 

This library is not accepting any issues or PRs and remains here
as just a supporting piller to the main image editor.

You may look at the source code put under `wyper/`
but beware, it is not well structured or documented!

* `wyper/colors.py` contains color themeing
* `wyper/layouthandler.py` contains layout handling code to calculate layout
* `wyper/widgets.py` contains code for widgets, their layout management, and rendering along with mouse events
